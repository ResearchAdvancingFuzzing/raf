# A minimal containerized panda that performs a taint analysis

# You can build this panda container from here with the following

docker build -t panda_spitfire .

# And there's a long line of commands at the bottom of the Docker file
# that will do the following as a demonstration
#
# 1. Create a panda recording of running the program toy (32-bit linux) 
#    on a sample input, i.e. executing "transfer/toy transfer/testsmall.bin" 
#    inside a 32-bit linux guest
# 
# 2. Replay that recording with two panda plugins enabled. 'file_taint' 
#    plugin applys positional taint labels to file reads (first byte read 
#    gets label 1, second gets label 2, etc). 'tainted_branch' plugin queries
#    register used in conditional branches and, if tainted, logs taint info to
#    the pandalog: transfer/toy.plog.
#
# 3. Use the plog_reader.py script to create human readable version of the
#    pandalog in transfer/toy.plog.txt
#

docker run  -v `pwd`/transfer:/transfer panda18
