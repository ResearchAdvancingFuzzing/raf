# RAF Setup

## Installation: 
Follow the instructions at https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/ to install minikube, kubectl, and optionally (see below) a hypervisor (e.g. virtualbox). The instructions to install minikube and kubectl for linux are reproduced below for convenience: 
```
curl -Lo minikube https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/latest/minikube-linux-amd64 \
  && chmod +x minikube
sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/bin/
sudo install minikube /usr/local/bin/

sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y apt-transport-https gnupg2
curl -s https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
echo "deb https://apt.kubernetes.io/ kubernetes-xenial main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y kubectl
```
## Setup Env: 
#### gRPC setup
On your host computer, you need to have python3.6 and pip already installed. 
```
sudo apt-get install python3.6 python3-pip
```
You then need to install the the following python packages in order to make the grpcio python files from the .proto file in the run script.
```
sudo python3.6 -m pip install grpcio  grpcio-tools
```
#### Minikube setup
Run **one** of the following sets of commands to setup the single-node Kubernetes cluster: 
1. In a docker container: (preferred) 
```
minikue start --vm-driver=docker
```
**NOTE**: Running minikube with root user is not allowed here.
3. In a virtual machine on your host computer: (preferred)
Run the following commands in order to set up the cluster in a virtual machine on your personal computer and configure your environment to re-use the docker daemon inside the minikube instance. NOTE: you need to make sure that the virtualbox has enough memory (greater than the default)! 
```
minikube start --vm-driver=virtualbox
eval $(minikube docker-env)
```
3. On your host computer (which should be a VM environment): 
If you already have a virtual linux environment, you can use the following to set the cluster up on your **host** virtual machine.
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install conntrack docker.io
sudo groupadd docker # Note this group may already be added; that is ok
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER 
sudo minikube start --vm-driver=none
sudo chown -R $USER $HOME/.minikube
sudo chown -R $USER $HOME/.kube
```
**NOTE**: You need to log out and log back in for the docker permissions to take effect.
#### Minikube clean up
To delete the cluster created, run
```
minikube delete
```
## Setup RAF directory:
After cloning this repository, run the `setup.sh` script in order to pull the gtfo repo and make the protobuf files. 
```
git clone <this_repo> 
cd raf
./setup.sh 
```
Note: Run this only once, when you have a clean clone of the RAF repo. 
## Build a campaign 
After initial setup, you can now either (1) run an already existing experiment in RAF or (2) create your own experiment. 
#### Using an existing experiment
TODO. There are no existing experiments currently. 
#### Creating a new experiemnt
To run a new experiment, you need to (1) make the relevant changes, (2) commit the changes, and (3) tag the commit. Note: if you do not commit the changes or you do not have a tag associated with the commit, the campaign will not run. 
To tag, run the following:
```
git tag <tag_name> <commit_hash>
./raf-commit <tag_name> 
```
To start the campaign, run
```
./raf-run
```
This will create the the name of the campaign id using the commit hash and the tag name. This script will create/update the proto files, build all the docker images for this campaign, and then start up the campaign. 
## Monitoring RAF:

#### Monitoring Cluster with Script
Under `spitfire/utils` we have included a sample monitoring script, `monitor.py`, that will display statistics and graphs regarding the fuzzing events that have occurred throughout the fuzzing campaign in the cluster. To run, you first need to make sure the following python packages are installed: 
```
pip3 install grpcio grpcio-tools hydra-core
pip3 install pyyaml 
pip3 install google-api-python-client protobuf 
pip3 install google-auth

git clone --recursive https://github.com/kubernetes-client/python.git
cd python
sudo python3.6 setup.py install 
```
You also need to make sure you have a way of displaying these graphs if you are running the cluster inside a non-GUI host (X11 forwarding with ssh is a good option). You then can run the `monitor.py`. 
```
python3.6 monitor.py
```
#### Monitoring Cluster Manually
To debug or get status updates about the pods that are running, run any of the following:
```
kubectl get pods
kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
kubectl logs <pod-name>
```
This first of these displays the pod's `name` (used in commands after) and the pod's `status` (usually one of Pending, Initx:x, Running, Completed, Error). 
- Jobs run to completion so should display a Completed status when they are finished. 
- Deployments/Services run indefinitely so should display a Running status.

The second command displays detailed information about the pod's configuration and events and the last command displays the output (e.g. print statements) from the container running inside the pod.

Note: These commands can display information about any Kubernetes object. The general case is as follows: 
```
kubectl get <object>
kubectl describe <object> <object-name>
```
See documentation at https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/ for more information on how to use kubectl. 
#### Monitoring a Campaign 
Note: The above commands show objects, by default, in the **default** namespace only. If there is nothing running in the default namespace, nothing will be displayed. In order to see the kubernetes objects in a different namespace (i.e. in a specific campaign), run the following:
```
kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=<campaign-id> 
```
#### Exec a Pod
In order to get a shell to a **running** container (useful for debugging and testing), run the following:
```
kubectl exec -it <pod-name> -- bash
```
## Suspending a campaign
To suspend, you can simply run the following script to patch and suspend the fuzzing manager cron job that drives the campaign.  
```
./suspend.sh <campaign-id>
```
## Cleaning up
In order to clean up all the kubernetes objects from the campaign, run the following:
```
./stop.sh <campaign-id> 
```
